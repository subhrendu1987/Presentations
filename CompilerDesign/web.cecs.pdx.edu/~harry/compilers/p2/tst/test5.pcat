(* This file tests identifiers.  When the lexer scans an ID,
   it will return the attribute sValue set to point to a
   String giving the characters in the ID.  Whenever the same
   ID is scanned, the lexer must set "sValue" to point to
   the same String, not just an equal String with the same
   characters.

   The "main" method will test that the lexer does this.  The
   "main" routine will watch for certain ID's and will remember
   the "sValue" associated with them and will test whenever the
   same ID re-appears in the source.
