I said, "What comes after caret, not what comes after carrot!"
<br>
<br>

Give me any more of those awful carrots and I'll show you a bottom-up parser!
<br>
<br>

Now students, you'll have this memorized by next week or I'll force-feed baby food to you, too.
<br>
<br>

Oh come on Dad, I still have to finish my dissertation by Sunday.
<br>
<br>

Do you understand it now, Daddy?  Or shall we go over it again?
<br>
<br>

No sweat, I'm ready to move up to solids!
<br>
<br>

You think you're a mess; look at this!
<br>
<br>

No, Dad, you use GOTO to find that set.
<br>
<br>

Roadmap to puberty???
<br>
<br>

What's up, Doc?
<br>
<br>

[Dad thinks:] "My boy is brilliant."
<br>
[Baby thinks:]  "This connect-the-dots game is making me dizzy... And you wonder why the food doesn't stay in my mouth!"
<br>
<br>

It's better than carrots.
<br>
<br>

If I just pretend like I'm paying attention, I'll get more carrots.
<br>
<br>

Who will be the next compiler in your generation?
<br>
<br>

A diagram soon to be modeled crudely, but enthusiastically, with Spaghetti.
<br>
<br>

That DFA won't recognize carrots... why should I?
<br>
<br>

Daddy, why does "if" have two 'f's?
<br>
<br>

Can I eat that too?
<br>
<br>

It's yummy.
<br>
<br>

Dad, I think I'm going to end with an ERROR.  Maybe it's time to REDUCE the carrot input and SHIFT to the yummy pear input!  That I'll ACCEPT!
<br>
<br>

Dad, I didn't digest those LR rules the first time.  Can you explain them to me again?
<br>
<br>

Seems delicious!  You want me to eat that, too?
<br>
