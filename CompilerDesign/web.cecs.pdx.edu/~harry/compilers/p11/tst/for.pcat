(* This program tests the code for for-loops. *)

program is

  var i: integer := 0;
      a: integer := 1;

begin
  write ("Should print 1,2,3,...,10:");
  for i := 1 to 10 do
    write (i);
  end;
  write ("Should print 1,3,5,...,9:");
  for i := 1 to 10 by 2 do
    write (i);
  end;
  write ("Should print 1,3,5,...,9:");
  i := 1;
  for i := a*i to (a+9)*i by i+i do
    write (i);
  end;
end;
